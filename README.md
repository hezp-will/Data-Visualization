# Data-Visualization

This repo contains a series of data visualization projects to visualize different kinds of data.
# Here are some examples
# CT Image
Load CT data and generate coresponding 3D grids of values to form CT image. Also create an application that plots horizontal slices abimation of the 3D CT data where the height of the slice is controlled via buttons and a slider.

# Digital elevation maps
Plot a digital elevation map (DEM) for the Grand Canyon as a 3D surfacecompute, and generated surfaces represented as a mesh of triangle
